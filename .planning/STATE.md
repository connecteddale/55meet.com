# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-27)

**Core value:** The 55 catches alignment problems before they become execution problems. 55 minutes. Once a month. The truth about where the team actually is.
**Current focus:** v2.5 Interactive Demo

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements for v2.5
Last activity: 2026-01-27 — Milestone v2.5 Interactive Demo started

## Current Milestone: v2.5 Interactive Demo

**Goal:** Let landing page visitors experience Signal Capture and see what synthesis reveals — without needing a real team.

**Key decisions from questioning:**
- Fictional company: ClearBrief ($65M legal tech SaaS)
- Strategy: "Help law firms win clients through transparency — open billing, open matters, no surprises."
- Team: Visitor + 4 fictional members (names shuffled from pool)
- Gap revealed: Alignment (handoff/coordination between product and client teams)
- No AI calls — all content pre-baked except visitor's image selection
