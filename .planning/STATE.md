# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting v2.6:
- Interactive Demo (v2.5): Demo-first approach validates Snapshot™ experience before conversion optimization
- View Transitions API: Progressive enhancement pattern extends to landing page sections
- Privacy-first tracking: SQLite event logging chosen over external analytics (no cookies, data ownership)
- Snapshot™ rebrand: "Signal Capture" renamed to "Snapshot™" (trademark of Dale Williams)

**Phase 26-01 (Snapshot Rebrand):**
- Trademark notation pattern: ™ on first visible use per page, omitted on subsequent uses for readability
- HTML titles and code comments use plain "Snapshot" without trademark
- Landing page article link uses existing .landing-link CSS class for consistency

**Phase 26-02 (Client Examples):**
- Three client example cards showing before/after transformations
- Card structure: Label, Title, Before/After, Gap type badge
- Examples: Asset Manager (geographic expansion), EdTech (priority alignment), Professional Services (growth strategy)

**Phase 26-03 (Outcomes & Enhanced CTA):**
- Outcomes positioned after facilitator, before contrast - bridges "who" to "what you get"
- Three specific benefits: faster execution, clearer priorities, less wasted work
- Dual CTA pattern: primary demo button + secondary email link with pre-filled subject
- Demo button text "Try the Demo" more action-oriented than "See how it works"

**Phase 27-01 (Demo Intro Snapshot™ Explanation):**
- WHY/HOW/WHEN framework for explaining Snapshot™ perception capture process
- Enhanced explanation: bypasses internal editor, image+bullets, first 5 minutes, blind
- Trademark pattern: ™ on first use (headline), plain "Snapshot" thereafter
- Education-before-action pattern: visitors understand mechanism before participating

**Phase 27-02 (Synthesis Conversion Personalization):**
- Email CTA as primary conversion action (connectedworld@gmail.com)
- Gap-type personalized conversion section replaces generic footer
- Three distinct challenges: Direction ("pulling in same direction"), Alignment ("work fitting together"), Commitment ("rowing same boat")
- Visceral personal question: "What would finding YOUR [gap] drag be worth? A quarter? Two?"
- Removes competing CTAs (calendar link, More about Dale, Back to top)
- Single clear action after peak emotional moment (gap reveal)

**Phase 28-01 (SEO Meta Tags):**
- Meta description formula: 128 chars mentioning Snapshot™ and three gap types (Direction, Alignment, Commitment)
- Open Graph + Twitter Card tags for social sharing link previews
- Trademark symbol (™) used directly in meta tags, consistent with Phase 26 pattern
- Open Graph image placeholder: /static/images/og-share.jpg (image creation not in Phase 28-01 scope)

### Pending Todos

None — cleared at milestone start.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Non-blocking (carried forward):**
- Permission ownership inconsistency (DrPloy vs www-data) - operational concern, doesn't affect v2.6 features

**v2.6-specific validation needed:**
- Dale voice review: All conversion copy must match consultative tone (affects Phases 26-27 messaging)
- Mobile demo completion baseline: Unknown device breakdown for demo completion rates (Phase 28 tracking validates)

## Client Example Cards (for Phase 26)

Three client vignettes for "What finding the drag looks like" section:

**1. Asset Manager — Geographic Expansion**
- Before: Unclear on strategy for geographic expansion
- After: Senior team fully aligned on expansion strategy
- Gap type: Direction

**2. EdTech Company — Priority Alignment**
- Before: Disconnected priorities across divisions
- After: Clear business-wide priorities with divisional alignment
- Gap type: Alignment

**3. Professional Services Firm — Growth Strategy**
- Before: Uncertain how to grow as part of international network
- After: Identified strategic levers for expansion
- Gap type: Direction
