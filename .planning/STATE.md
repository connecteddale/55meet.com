## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting v2.6:
- Interactive Demo (v2.5): Demo-first approach validates Snapshot™ experience before conversion optimization
- View Transitions API: Progressive enhancement pattern extends to landing page sections
- Privacy-first tracking: SQLite event logging chosen over external analytics (no cookies, data ownership)
- Snapshot™ rebrand: "Signal Capture" renamed to "Snapshot™" (trademark of Dale Williams)

**Phase 26-02 (Client Examples):**
- CSS pseudo-elements for Before/After labels: Keeps HTML semantic while maintaining visual hierarchy
- Section positioning between Evidence and Drift: Problem → proof → solution conversion flow
- Three diverse client examples: Shows variety of industries and both gap types (Direction/Alignment)

### Pending Todos

None — cleared at milestone start.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Non-blocking (carried forward):**
- Permission ownership inconsistency (DrPloy vs www-data) - operational concern, doesn't affect v2.6 features

**v2.6-specific validation needed:**
- Dale voice review: All conversion copy must match consultative tone (affects Phases 26-27 messaging)
- Mobile demo completion baseline: Unknown device breakdown for demo completion rates (Phase 28 tracking validates)

## Client Example Cards (for Phase 26)

Three client vignettes for "What finding the drag looks like" section:

**1. Asset Manager — Geographic Expansion**
- Before: Unclear on strategy for geographic expansion
- After: Senior team fully aligned on expansion strategy
- Gap type: Direction

**2. EdTech Company — Priority Alignment**
- Before: Disconnected priorities across divisions
- After: Clear business-wide priorities with divisional alignment
- Gap type: Alignment

**3. Professional Services Firm — Growth Strategy**
- Before: Uncertain how to grow as part of international network
- After: Identified strategic levers for expansion
- Gap type: Direction
