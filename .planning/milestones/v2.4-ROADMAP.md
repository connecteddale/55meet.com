# Milestone v2.4: Effortless — UX Refinement

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-24
**Phases:** 34-37
**Total Plans:** 9

## Overview

Reduce participant flow from 7 screens to 4, facilitator actions from 4 to 2, with smooth animated transitions throughout.

## Phases

### Phase 34: State Machine & Auto-Flow

**Goal**: Simplify session lifecycle — creating starts immediately, closing auto-synthesizes, synthesis auto-reveals.
**Depends on**: None
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 34-01: Remove DRAFT state, add image subset limit
- [x] 34-02: Auto-synthesize on close, auto-reveal, enhanced polling
- [x] 34-03: Admin UI cleanup (remove manual buttons)

**Details:**
1. Remove DRAFT from SessionState enum, update all references
2. Database migration: `UPDATE sessions SET state = 'capturing' WHERE state = 'draft'`
3. Modify `/admin/sessions/{id}/close` to trigger background synthesis automatically
4. Modify synthesis service to set state=REVEALED + revealed_at when synthesis completes
5. Enhanced `/status` endpoints: add `synthesis_progress` object (status, message)
6. Add `limit` parameter to `get_shuffled_images()`, default 60
7. Update admin UI: remove Draft controls, remove manual Synthesize/Reveal buttons
8. Keep manual endpoints as fallback (synthesis retry on failure)

### Phase 35: Participant Flow Reduction

**Goal**: Eliminate 3 screens from participant journey — auto-join, skip month, merge strategy into browser.
**Depends on**: Phase 34
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 35-01: Auto-join route, auto-skip month, strategy redirect
- [x] 35-02: Strategy banner on respond page, name card grid

**Details:**
1. Auto-join: When URL contains team code, skip join screen and go directly to session/name
2. Auto-skip month: If team has exactly one CAPTURING session, skip month selection
3. Strategy merger: Display strategy statement as compact header on image browser page
4. Name cards: Replace radio button list with CSS Grid card/chip layout (auto-fit, minmax 140px)
5. Remove or redirect old strategy screen route

### Phase 36: Interaction Polish

**Goal**: Smooth animations and progressive disclosure throughout participant flow.
**Depends on**: None
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 36-01: View Transitions CSS + image selection animation polish
- [x] 36-02: Progressive bullet input disclosure

**Details:**
1. View Transitions CSS: Add `@view-transition { navigation: auto; }` to main.css
2. Custom transition animations: fade for forward navigation, slide for back
3. Image selection: `transform: scale(1.03)` + border-color change on tap, 0.2s ease-out
4. Touch feedback: `@media (hover: hover)` for desktop hover, tap states for mobile
5. Progressive inputs: Start with 1 textarea, reveal next on input
6. Accessibility: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` disables all animations

### Phase 37: Meeting View & Live Feedback

**Goal**: Automate projector view transitions and show live progress on participant waiting screen.
**Depends on**: Phase 34
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 37-01: Participant waiting screen: live names + View Transition redirect
- [x] 37-02: Meeting view: control strip + View Transition state changes

**Details:**
1. Waiting screen: Show submitted member names as they check in (from polling data)
2. Waiting → results: Use View Transitions API for smooth animated redirect
3. Meeting view: Auto-transition between states (QR/status → analyzing → synthesis)
4. Bottom control strip: Fixed bar with "Close Capture" button
5. Meeting view uses View Transitions for state changes (wrap reload in startViewTransition)
6. Enhanced status polling: Include member names who have submitted

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Remove DRAFT state entirely (no deprecation path — clean break)
- 60-image limit for participant browser (cognitive load reduction)
- Auto-reveal only on synthesis success; failures keep CLOSED for manual retry
- View Transitions API over SPA framework (progressive enhancement, no build tools)
- No "Reveal Results" button in meeting view (auto-reveal from Phase 34 handles this)
- Hover/touch separation via @media (hover: hover)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Participant flow too many screens (7 → 4)
- Facilitator had to manually trigger synthesize + reveal (now automatic)
- No live feedback for participants waiting (now shows names + count)
- Meeting view required switching to admin panel for actions (now has control strip)

**Issues Deferred:**
- Interactive demo (deferred from v2.2, remains out of scope)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant — all changes are additive/progressive enhancement
