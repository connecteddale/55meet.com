## v2.3 Requirements

Requirements for PDF Export release. Single focused feature.

### PDF Export

- [x] **PDF-01**: PDF export button appears alongside existing JSON/MD export buttons
- [x] **PDF-02**: PDF contains team name and session date
- [x] **PDF-03**: PDF contains the team's 3AM strategy statement
- [x] **PDF-04**: PDF contains synthesis themes (Level 1)
- [x] **PDF-05**: PDF contains key insights with attribution (Level 2)
- [x] **PDF-06**: Clean minimal design — simple typography, white background, no heavy branding
- [x] **PDF-07**: PDF downloads with descriptive filename (e.g., `TeamName-2026-01.pdf`)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |

| Include participant images in PDF | Increases complexity and file size significantly |
| Include raw participant responses | Report focuses on synthesis value, not raw data |
| Custom branding/logo options | Clean minimal design is the goal |
| Email PDF directly | Manual download and share for now |
| PDF password protection | Unnecessary complexity |

## Traceability
