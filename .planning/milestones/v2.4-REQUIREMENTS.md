## v2.4 Requirements

UX refinement to reduce participant friction and automate facilitator workflow.

### Flow Simplification

- [x] **FLOW-01**: Participant auto-joins session when team code is in URL (no join button tap)
- [x] **FLOW-02**: Month selection auto-skipped when only one capturing session exists
- [x] **FLOW-03**: Strategy statement merged into image browser header (removes separate strategy screen)
- [x] **FLOW-04**: DRAFT state removed — creating session immediately starts CAPTURING
- [x] **FLOW-05**: Synthesis auto-triggered when facilitator closes capture
- [x] **FLOW-06**: Session auto-reveals to participants when synthesis completes

### Touch Interactions

- [x] **TOUCH-01**: Name picker rendered as tappable card/chip grid (replaces radio buttons)
- [x] **TOUCH-02**: Image selection shows subtle + confident animation (gentle scale + border)
- [x] **TOUCH-03**: Bullet inputs start with 1 field, progressively grow to max 5 as user types

### Live Feedback

- [x] **LIVE-01**: Waiting screen shows live progress (names checking in as they submit)
- [x] **LIVE-02**: Seamless animated transition from waiting to synthesis results
- [x] **LIVE-03**: Meeting projector auto-transitions through states (QR → progress → analyzing)
- [x] **LIVE-04**: Bottom control strip on projected view (Close Capture, contextual state hints)

### Polish

- [x] **POLISH-01**: Smooth CSS page transitions between all participant screens (fade/slide via View Transitions API)
- [x] **POLISH-02**: Random ~60 image subset per session from full library (server-side, session-seeded)
