## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real AI synthesis in demo | Expensive, unnecessary — pre-baked content sufficient |
| User accounts for demo | Frictionless experience is key |
| Saving demo responses | No persistence needed for demo |
| Multiple demo scenarios | Start with one scenario, iterate |
