<objective>
Enhance demo intro to explain Snapshot™ as perception capture process that bypasses internal editor.

Purpose: Visitors need to understand WHY the image selection process works before they do it. Current intro mentions Snapshot™ exists but doesn't explain the mechanism (perception capture before filtering kicks in).

Output: Updated intro.html with enhanced Snapshot™ explanation section.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Enhance Snapshot™ explanation section</name>
  <files>templates/demo/intro.html</files>
  <action>
Update the existing Snapshot section (id="process") in intro.html to better explain WHY Snapshot works:

**Current content to replace (lines 394-406):**
```html
<section id="process" class="demo-section">
    <div class="demo-content reveal">
        <p class="demo-eyebrow">The Process</p>
        <h2 class="demo-headline">The 55 plus Snapshot™</h2>
        <p class="demo-body">Snapshot™ is a unique team process that bypasses people's internal editor and reveals what they actually think, not what they think they should say.</p>
        <p class="demo-body">The 55 starts with Snapshot</p>
    </div>
    ...
</section>
```

**Replace with enhanced explanation:**
```html
<section id="process" class="demo-section">
    <div class="demo-content reveal">
        <p class="demo-eyebrow">The Process</p>
        <h2 class="demo-headline">Snapshot™ Perception Capture</h2>
        <p class="demo-body">Snapshot is how The 55 captures what your team actually thinks—before the internal editor kicks in, before the meeting-safe answers, before consensus softens the truth.</p>
        <p class="demo-body">You select an image that represents your current state, then explain why in bullet points. No presentations. No filtering. Just signal.</p>
        <p class="demo-body">This happens in the first 5 minutes, before anyone knows what anyone else said.</p>
    </div>
    <a href="#team" class="demo-scroll-cue" aria-label="Scroll down">
        <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5"><path d="M12 5v14M5 12l7 7 7-7"/></svg>
    </a>
</section>
```

**Key changes:**
1. Headline: "The 55 plus Snapshot™" → "Snapshot™ Perception Capture" (more descriptive)
2. First paragraph: Keep the bypass internal editor concept, enhance phrasing
3. Add explanation of HOW it works: image selection + bullet points
4. Add timing: "first 5 minutes, before anyone knows what anyone else said"
5. Trademark: ™ on "Snapshot™" in headline (first use), plain "Snapshot" thereafter
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `grep -A 15 'id="process"' /var/www/sites/55meet.com/templates/demo/intro.html`

Should show:
- Headline: "Snapshot™ Perception Capture"
- Body text mentions: "internal editor", "image", "bullet points", "5 minutes"
- No ™ after first occurrence
  </verify>
  <done>
Demo intro explains Snapshot™ as perception capture process with:
- WHY it works (bypasses internal editor)
- HOW it works (image selection + bullet points)
- WHEN it happens (first 5 minutes, before anyone knows what others said)
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify demo flow continuity</name>
  <files>templates/demo/intro.html</files>
  <action>
Verify the updated section maintains proper navigation flow:

1. Check that the scroll cue link points to #team (next section after Snapshot explanation)
2. Ensure the section comment is accurate (currently says "Section 5: Snapshot Intro")
3. Verify existing CSS classes are used (demo-section, demo-content, reveal, demo-eyebrow, demo-headline, demo-body, demo-scroll-cue)

No styling changes needed - use existing demo-section styles that match the rest of intro.html.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `curl -s http://localhost:8055/demo | grep -o 'id="process"'`
Should return: id="process"

Run: `curl -s http://localhost:8055/demo | grep -c "Snapshot™ Perception Capture"`
Should return: 1

Check navigation: `curl -s http://localhost:8055/demo | grep -o 'href="#team"' | head -1`
Should return: href="#team"
  </verify>
  <done>
Demo intro page loads successfully with enhanced Snapshot section and proper navigation to team section.

Overall plan verification:

1. Page loads without errors:
   `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8055/demo`
   Expected: 200

2. Snapshot™ explanation present:
   `curl -s http://localhost:8055/demo | grep "perception capture\|internal editor\|bullet points"`
   Expected: Match on all three concepts

3. Trademark notation correct:
   `curl -s http://localhost:8055/demo | grep -c "Snapshot™"`
   Expected: 1 (only first use gets ™)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- SNAP-03 satisfied: Demo intro explains Snapshot™ as perception capture before filtering
- Visitor understands WHY (bypasses internal editor)
- Visitor understands HOW (image + bullets)
- Visitor understands WHEN (first 5 minutes, private)
- Trademark notation matches Phase 26 pattern (™ on first use only)
- Demo flow unchanged - scroll navigation preserved
</success_criteria>
