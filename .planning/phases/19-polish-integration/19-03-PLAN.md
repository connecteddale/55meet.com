  <name>Task 1: Add Font Preconnect for Performance</name>
  <files>the55/app/templates/base.html</files>
  <action>
  Add font preconnect hints to base.html head section (before the CSS link):
  ```html
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  ```

  Place these before the main.css link so the browser can start DNS/connection early.

  Note: The fonts already use display=swap (confirmed in research), so this is the main performance quick win remaining.

  <verify>
  - View page source - preconnect links appear before CSS
  - Network tab shows early connection to fonts.googleapis.com

  Phase 28 polish work:
  - Plan 01: Skip link, focus-visible styles, status badge icons
  - Plan 02: Custom 404/500 error pages with exception handlers
  - Plan 03: Font preconnect optimization
  - Plan 04: Navigation consistency, loading states
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
  **Accessibility Verification:**
  1. Open http://55.connecteddale.com/ in browser
  2. Press Tab key - skip link should appear at top of page
  3. Press Enter - focus should move to main content
  4. Tab through page - focus rings visible on interactive elements
  5. Click with mouse - no focus rings should appear on click

  **Status Badge Verification:**
  6. Log in to facilitator dashboard
  7. View sessions with different states (draft, capturing, closed, revealed)
  8. Each state badge should show a colored dot before the text

  **Error Page Verification:**
  9. Visit http://55.connecteddale.com/nonexistent-page
  10. Should see friendly 404 page with "Page Not Found" heading
  11. Navigation buttons should be styled and functional

  **Navigation Consistency Verification:**
  12. Navigate through admin pages: Dashboard -> Sessions -> Edit -> Back
  13. All admin pages should have consistent nav with Dashboard/Settings links and Logout
  14. Back buttons should return to expected locations

  **Loading States Verification:**
  15. On image browser, click page number - spinner should appear during load
  16. Submit a form - button should show loading state

  **Performance Verification:**
  17. Open Chrome DevTools Network tab
  18. Reload page - check that fonts.googleapis.com connection starts early
  19. Page should load quickly (LCP under 1.5s if network is good)

  **v2.2 Requirements Spot Check:**
  20. Landing page loads with premium styling (LAND-*)
  21. Dashboard shows sessions prominently (DASH-01)
  22. Meeting screen transitions work (MEET-*)
