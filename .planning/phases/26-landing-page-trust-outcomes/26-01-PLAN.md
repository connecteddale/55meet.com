<objective>
Rebrand "Signal Capture" to "Snapshot™" across the entire application.

Purpose: Dale's perception capture technology is now trademarked as "Snapshot™". All references must use consistent branding with proper trademark notation (™ on first use per page, plain Snapshot thereafter).

Output: All templates and code updated with Snapshot branding, landing page links to Snapshot article.

Replace all "Signal Capture" references with "Snapshot" following trademark rules:

**Trademark notation rules:**
- First visible use on each HTML page: "Snapshot™" (with trademark symbol)
- Subsequent uses on same page: "Snapshot" (no trademark)
- HTML titles, comments, and non-visible text: "Snapshot" (no trademark)
- Python docstrings: "Snapshot" (no trademark)

**Files and specific changes:**

1. `templates/demo/intro.html`:
   - Line 394 comment: "Signal Capture Intro" → "Snapshot Intro"
   - Line 398 heading: "The 55 plus Signal Capture™" → "The 55 plus Snapshot™"
   - Line 399: "Signal Capture™ is a unique..." → "Snapshot™ is a unique..."
   - Line 400: "starts with Signal Capture™" → "starts with Snapshot"
   - Line 411: "completed Signal Capture™" → "completed Snapshot"

2. `templates/demo/team.html`:
   - Line 262: "Signal Capture™" → "Snapshot™" (first use on page)

3. `templates/demo/prepare.html`:
   - Line 3 title: "Signal Capture - Demo" → "Snapshot - Demo"
   - Line 166 heading: "Signal Capture™" → "Snapshot™" (first use on page)

4. `templates/demo/prompt.html`:
   - Line 3 title: "Signal Capture - Demo" → "Snapshot - Demo"
   - Line 154 button: "Begin Signal Capture" → "Begin Snapshot"

5. `templates/demo/signal.html`:
   - Line 3 title: "Signal Capture - Demo" → "Snapshot - Demo"

6. `templates/demo/layers.html`:
   - Line 379: "Signal Capture™ responses" → "Snapshot™ responses" (first use on page)

7. `static/js/demo-signal.js`:
   - Line 2 comment: "Demo Signal Capture JavaScript" → "Demo Snapshot JavaScript"

8. `app/routers/demo.py`:
   - Line 126 docstring: "Signal Capture explanation" → "Snapshot explanation"
   - Line 207 docstring: "explains Signal Capture" → "explains Snapshot"
   - Line 233 docstring: "invites Signal Capture" → "invites Snapshot"
   - Line 304 docstring: "Demo Signal Capture page" → "Demo Snapshot page"

    grep -rn "Signal Capture" templates/demo/ static/js/demo-signal.js app/routers/demo.py 2>/dev/null | grep -v ".pyc" || echo "No Signal Capture references found (expected)"
  </verify>
  <done>
    Zero "Signal Capture" references remain in demo templates, demo JS, or demo router. All pages show "Snapshot™" on first use, "Snapshot" on subsequent uses.
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Update landing page with Snapshot branding and article link</name>
  <files>templates/landing.html</files>
  <action>
Update line 66 in templates/landing.html:

Current:
```html
<p class="landing-body">The 55 and Signal Capture™ surfaces what your team actually believes, not what they think they should say.</p>
```

Replace with:
```html
<p class="landing-body">The 55 and <a href="https://connecteddale.com/releases/Snapshot.html" class="landing-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snapshot™</a> surfaces what your team actually believes, not what they think they should say.</p>
```

This accomplishes:
1. Renames "Signal Capture™" to "Snapshot™"
2. Links to the Snapshot article on connecteddale.com
3. Uses existing `.landing-link` CSS class for consistent styling
4. Opens in new tab with proper rel attributes for security

Note: This is the only "Signal Capture" reference on the landing page, so it gets the ™ notation.
  </action>
  <verify>
    grep -n "Snapshot" templates/landing.html && grep -n "connecteddale.com/releases/Snapshot" templates/landing.html
  </verify>
  <done>
    Landing page shows "Snapshot™" with working link to https://connecteddale.com/releases/Snapshot.html. No "Signal Capture" references remain.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. No "Signal Capture" text visible anywhere in the application
