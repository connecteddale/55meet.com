<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Landing Page HTML Structure</name>
  <files>the55/app/templates/landing.html</files>
  <action>
Replace the existing landing.html with a complete landing page following Duarte/Jobs minimalism principles.

**Page structure (5 sections, each one idea):**

1. **Hero Section (above fold)**
   - Single headline: "Catch alignment drift before it compounds"
   - Subheadline: "55 minutes. Once a month. The truth about where your team actually is."
   - Primary CTA: "See How It Works" -> /demo (large, prominent button)
   - Secondary link: "Facilitator Login" -> /admin/login (subtle, below CTA)
   - Clean, minimal - no images needed in hero

2. **Problem Section**
   - Headline: "Most alignment check-ins are theater"
   - Body: 2-3 sentences about surface-level meetings where everyone nods but nothing surfaces
   - Confident tone: "You leave thinking you're aligned. You're not."

3. **Stakes Section**
   - Headline: "Drift compounds"
   - Body: What happens when misalignment goes undetected (wasted quarters, frustrated teams, missed opportunities)
   - Short, punchy - make the cost felt

4. **Solution Section**
   - Headline: "55 minutes of truth"
   - Body: How The 55 works - image selection surfaces what words can't, synthesis reveals patterns
   - Show the "a-ha": "What you learn in 55 minutes would take weeks to surface otherwise"

5. **CTA Section (bottom)**
   - Headline: "Every CEO should be doing this"
   - Primary CTA: "Try the Demo" -> /demo
   - Secondary: "Contact Dale" link (mailto or external)
   - Footer: "A tool by Dale Williams, Strategy Coach"

**Technical requirements:**
- Use semantic HTML5 (section, header, main, footer)
- Link to /static/css/landing.css for page-specific styles
- Import main.css for base styles and design tokens
- Add meta description for SEO
- Ensure all links use correct paths (/demo, /admin/login, /join)

**Content tone (per research):**
- Confident, direct, slightly provocative
- No hedging ("might help" -> "will surface")
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Jobs-style declarative statements
  </action>
  <verify>
Open landing.html in browser at http://localhost:8055/
- Page loads without errors
- All 5 sections visible
- Links functional (/demo shows 404 for now - expected, /admin/login works)
  </verify>
  <done>
Landing page HTML complete with hero, problem, stakes, solution, and CTA sections. Content follows confident tone. All links present.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Landing Page CSS</name>
  <files>the55/app/static/css/landing.css, the55/app/static/css/main.css</files>
  <action>
Create landing.css with premium styling for the landing page sections.

**Layout principles (from research):**
- 60%+ white space - let content breathe
- Max 2 colors (primary blue, text gray) + white
- Vertical rhythm using spacing tokens
- Each section full viewport height on desktop, natural height on mobile

**Specific styles:**

1. **General section styling:**
```css
.landing-section {
  min-height: 100vh;  /* Full viewport sections on desktop */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: var(--space-8) var(--container-padding);
}

/* Mobile: natural height */
@media (max-width: 640px) {
  .landing-section {
    min-height: auto;
    padding: var(--space-16) var(--container-padding);
  }
}
```

2. **Hero section:**
- Centered content
- Headline: text-4xl (largest), tight letter-spacing, dark text (#1d1d1f)
- Subheadline: text-xl, secondary color (#6e6e73)
- CTA button: Large (padding-5 padding-8), primary color, prominent shadow
- Background: clean white or very subtle gradient (--color-bg)

3. **Content sections (problem, stakes, solution):**
- Left-aligned text (not centered - per research anti-pattern)
- Max-width for readability (var(--prose-max) = 65ch)
- Section headline: text-2xl or text-3xl
- Body: text-lg, relaxed line-height
- Generous vertical spacing between sections

4. **CTA section:**
- Centered, prominent
- Confident headline
- Large button matching hero CTA

5. **Footer:**
- Subtle, secondary text
- Link to Dale's site

**Mobile responsive (375px+):**
- Stack naturally
- Reduce headline sizes gracefully (clamp() handles this)
- Full-width buttons on mobile
- Adequate touch targets (44px min)

**Add import to main.css:**
Add `@import url('landing.css');` at the top of main.css ONLY if landing.css isn't already imported. Actually, better approach: link landing.css directly in landing.html template to keep styles scoped.
  </action>
  <verify>
- landing.css file exists at the55/app/static/css/landing.css
- Page renders with premium styling
- Desktop: sections are full viewport height
- Mobile (375px): no horizontal scroll, readable text, full-width buttons
  </verify>
  <done>
Landing page CSS complete with section layouts, typography hierarchy, generous whitespace, and mobile responsiveness.
  </done>

Complete landing page with:
- Hero section with headline, subheadline, and demo CTA above fold
- Problem section: "Most alignment check-ins are theater"
- Stakes section: "Drift compounds"
- Solution section: "55 minutes of truth"
- Bottom CTA section: "Every CEO should be doing this"

  <how-to-verify>
1. Visit http://localhost:8055/ on desktop
   - [ ] Can you understand what The 55 does within 5 seconds?
   - [ ] Is the "See How It Works" CTA button visible without scrolling?
   - [ ] Does scrolling reveal a clear problem -> stakes -> solution narrative?
   - [ ] Does each section communicate exactly ONE idea?
   - [ ] Does the page feel premium and confident (not cluttered)?

2. Visit on mobile (375px viewport or phone)
   - [ ] No horizontal scrolling required?
   - [ ] Text is readable without zooming?
   - [ ] Buttons are easy to tap (large enough)?
   - [ ] Page flows naturally when scrolling?

3. Click the links:
   - [ ] "See How It Works" / "Try the Demo" goes to /demo (404 expected - Phase 25)
   - [ ] "Facilitator Login" goes to /admin/login (should work)
