**Phases:** 23-24, 26-28 (Phase 25 deferred)

## Overview

Transform The 55 into a presentation-quality experience — Duarte/Jobs minimalist design, confident messaging, and streamlined facilitator workflow.

## Phases

### Phase 23: Design Foundation
**Goal**: Consistent design language across all v2.2 deliverables
**Depends on**: Phase 22
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 23-01: Design tokens (colors, fluid typography, spacing, shadows)
- [x] 23-02: Typography system + premium component patterns

**Details:**
- Inter font via Google Fonts (premium feel, SF Pro design DNA)
- Apple-inspired color palette (#1d1d1f, #6e6e73, #f5f5f7)
- Fluid typography with clamp() for responsive scaling
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming

### Phase 24: Landing Page
**Goal**: Cold visitors understand The 55 value in 5 seconds
**Depends on**: Phase 23

Plans:
- [x] 24-01: Landing page HTML/CSS with narrative sections and premium styling

**Details:**
- Full-viewport sections on desktop, natural height on mobile
- Problem-stakes-solution narrative structure
- Duarte "one idea per section" layout
- 100dvh for mobile hero (dynamic viewport height)

### Phase 25: Interactive Demo — REMOVED FROM v2.2 SCOPE
**Status**: Deferred to v2.3+
**Original Goal**: Zero-friction demonstration of The 55 value
**Reason for deferral**: Prioritized core facilitator experience; demo can be added in future milestone

Plans (not executed):
- 25-01: Demo fixtures (Velocity Labs, 5 personas, synthesis) and router
- 25-02: Demo templates and styling (11-step walkthrough)

### Phase 26: Facilitator Dashboard
**Goal**: One-click access to sessions and teams
**Depends on**: Phase 24
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 26-01: Dashboard backend with sessions-first queries and password change endpoints
- [x] 26-02: Dashboard UI, settings page, client-side search, premium styling

**Details:**
- Dashboard shows active sessions (current month, not revealed) first
- Recent sessions limited to 5 most recently revealed
- Password changes update .env file directly (requires restart)
- Client-side search filters by team name OR date

### Phase 27: Unified Meeting Screen
**Goal**: Single projectable screen for capture AND presentation
**Depends on**: Phase 26
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 27-01: Unified meeting endpoint, template structure, projector-optimized CSS
- [x] 27-02: Polling, transitions, animations, keyboard navigation

**Details:**
- State-driven template rendering (conditionals by session.state.value)
- clamp() typography for projector readability (24px+ body, 48px+ headings)
- Auto-reload on state change via polling
- Ceremony reveal animation with overshoot for visual impact

### Phase 28: Polish & Integration
**Goal**: Consistent quality across all v2.2 deliverables
**Depends on**: Phase 27
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 28-01: Accessibility improvements (skip link, focus-visible, status icons)
- [x] 28-02: Error handling (custom 404/500 pages, graceful degradation)
- [x] 28-03: Performance optimization and v2.2 verification
- [x] 28-04: Navigation consistency and loading states

**Details:**
- Skip link positioned at -40px, slides to top:0 on focus (WCAG 2.4.1)
- :focus-visible for keyboard-only focus rings (WCAG 2.4.7)
- Colored dots via ::before for color-independent status (WCAG 1.4.1)
- Standalone error templates (no base.html dependency for reliability)
- Consistent admin-nav pattern across all admin pages
- .btn-loading class for form submission feedback
