# v2.1 Facilitator Experience & Presentation

**Shipped:** 2026-01-20
**Phases:** 18-22 (7 plans)
**Duration:** 1 day (2026-01-19 → 2026-01-20)

## Summary

Enhanced The 55 App for real-world facilitation — expanded image library with auto-discovery, improved mobile browsing UX, flexible session flow controls, combined QR+status projection screen, and structured three-level synthesis presentation with keyboard navigation.

## Key Accomplishments

### Image Library Expansion (Phase 18)
- Auto-discovery from filesystem (no hardcoded list)
- Support for 200+ images (.svg, .png, .jpg, .webp)
- Session-seeded randomization for consistent ordering
- 5-minute cache TTL for performance
- Adding/removing images requires no code changes

### Participant Image Browser (Phase 19)
- Sticky header with always-visible pagination controls
- AJAX-based page loading (no full reload)
- "Page X of Y" progress indicator
- "Jump to selection" button for navigation
- iOS Safari sticky positioning with -webkit-sticky prefix
- sessionStorage persistence for page position

### Session Flow Controls (Phase 20)
- Close capture early (before all participants submit)
- Reopen capture for latecomers after closing
- Clear individual submission for participant resubmit
- State changes notify via polling

### Combined QR + Status (Phase 21)
- Single projectable screen with QR code and participant status
- 400px QR code for back-of-room scannability
- Real-time status showing submitted/not-submitted
- Dual-panel layout with mode-aware polling

### Synthesis Presentation (Phase 22)
- Level 1: High-level themes (AI synthesis)
- Level 2: Attributed grouped insights
- Level 3: Raw statements by person
- Keyboard navigation (1/2/3 keys)
- Per-level JSON export endpoints
- Synthesis retry with clear error UI
- synthesis-status polling endpoint

## Phases

| Phase | Name | Plans |
|-------|------|-------|
| 18 | Image Library Foundation | 1 |
| 19 | Participant Image Browser | 1 |
| 20 | Session Flow Controls | 2 |
| 21 | Combined QR + Status | 1 |
| 22 | Synthesis Presentation | 2 |

## Requirements Delivered

- 12 requirements across v2.1
- Categories: Image Library (3), Image Browser (5), Session Controls (3), Facilitator (3), Synthesis/Presentation (7)

### Requirements List

**Image Library:**
- LIB-01: Auto-discovery from directory
- LIB-02: Session-seeded randomization
- LIB-03: No code changes to add/remove images

**Image Browser:**
- IMG-01: Sticky navigation at top
- IMG-02: Page progress indicator
- IMG-03: Fixed instruction header
- IMG-04: ~20 images per page
- IMG-05: iOS Safari compatibility

**Session Controls:**
- SESS-01: Close capture early
- SESS-02: Reopen capture
- SESS-03: Clear individual submission

**Facilitator View:**
- FAC-09: Combined QR + status screen
- FAC-10: Large QR (400px+) scannable from back
- FAC-11: Real-time status updates

**Synthesis & Presentation:**
- SYNTH-04: Fix synthesis generation error
- SYNTH-05: Reliable synthesis during live sessions
- PRES-01: Level 1 themes view
- PRES-02: Level 2 attributed insights view
- PRES-03: Level 3 raw statements view
- PRES-04: Keyboard navigation (1/2/3)
- PRES-05: Level-specific JSON export

## Tech Decisions

- 5-minute cache TTL for image discovery
- Fisher-Yates shuffle with seeded random
- -webkit-sticky prefix for iOS Safari compatibility
- translate3d GPU hack for iOS flicker prevention
- sessionStorage for page position, localStorage for drafts
- Dual-panel capture layout with mode-aware polling
- 400px QR code for back-of-room scannability
- Tab navigation with data-level attributes
- Explicit retry endpoint clears synthesis before regeneration

## Stats

- 5 phases, 7 plans
- Total execution time: 17 minutes
- Average per plan: 2.4 minutes

## Additional Work (Post-Audit)

- Fixed polling.js selector mismatch (.session-control vs .capture-control)
- Fixed retry_synthesis to accept both CLOSED and REVEALED states
- Fixed image URL path (/static/images/55/)
- Added synthesis_gap_reasoning column and display
- Created landing page for 55meet.com domain
- Configured nginx and SSL for 55meet.com
